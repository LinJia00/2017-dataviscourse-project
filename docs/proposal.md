## Background and Motivation

Aangelist has [a database of 342 thousands](https://angel.co/companies) startups located in the United States. However, it doesn't provides us any visualization of it. So, our idea is visualizing these startups' features such as location, focused market, employee numbers, stage and total raised money. We believe that our project can not only extract fascinating insights and exciting visual effects but also it will be very useful for market analysis, job finding and recruiting.


## Project Objectives

By this project, we hope to represent users information hidden in the abstract data with appropriate visualization. And, with editable parameters such as filters, we provide user a basic tool to explore the data.


## Data

We will obtain our data from [Angelist's Database](https://angel.co/companies) and there is an API for this purpose.

## Data Processing

The data from Angelist is clean. However, we may need to filter out the companies lack the key attributes such as location, the number of employees and market.

## Visualization Design

- It can show a map located these companies which mean it is easy to make the area selection when the users want to find a job.
- It has several popular markets can be selected, such as education, mobile, healthcare, enterprise software, games, etc. So that gives users a specific career direction.
- It can search job by role, such as hardware engineer, developer, customer service, human resources, etc.
- It also can show the scale of a company. This project will contain the features of employee number and the total raised money. It will give users an overall view of the company they are interested in.
