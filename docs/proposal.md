## Background and Motivation

Aangelist has [a database of 342 thousand](https://angel.co/companies) startups located in the United States. However, it doesn't provide us any visualization of it. So, our idea is visualizing these startups' features such as location, focused market, employee numbers, stage and total raised money. We believe that our project can not only extract fascinating insights and exciting visual effects but also it will be very useful for market analysis, job finding and recruiting.


## Project Objectives

By this project, we hope to represent users information hidden in the abstract data with appropriate visualization. And, with editable parameters such as filters, we provide user a basic tool to explore the data.
And We want to learn more ways to do better designs and how to let data show specificly to the users.


## Data

We will obtain our data from [Angelist's Database](https://angel.co/companies) and there is an API for this purpose.

## Data Processing

The data from Angelist is clean. However, we may need to filter out the companies lack the key attributes such as location, the number of employees and market.

## Visualization Design


## Must-Have Features
- Top Market: It has several popular markets can be selected, such as education, mobile, healthcare, enterprise software, games, etc. So that gives users a specific career direction.
- Location: It can show a map located these companies which mean it is easy to make the area selection when the users want to find a job.
- Salary: The important factor when people want to find a job.
- Role: It can search job by role, such as hardware engineer, developer, customer service, human resources, etc.
- Time transition: It will give us an overall view of these companies.

## Optional Features
- Total raised money: Some time it doesn't matter for people who want finding a job.
- Stage(seed, seriesA, seriesB, seriesC): People may not concern about it.
- Employee Number: The company scale cannot represent its good or not.
